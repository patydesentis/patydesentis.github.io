		<h2 class="project-title">Goal</h2>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Design the scale-up model to expand the company’s microschools service outside of our founding city (Monterrey, Mexico), potentially without having to operate them ourselves.</p>
			
			<p>The strategy of the company was to create an expansion model outside the local state without operating them.</p>

			<h4 class="subtitle">Problem</h4>
			<p>In the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents started to look for new alternative educational models for their kids. Looking for ways to continue their development in a secure and affordable way.</p>

			<h4 class="subtitle">Metodology</h4>
			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">1. Identify the customer needs:</h6>
				<p>
					Got to know the families that were looking for educational alternatives for their children, their needs, and motivators through an application process follow-up by a deep interview:

				
				</p>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">2. Competitive landscape and Business Model design:</h6>
				<p>
					Understand the two large international players in the microschool industry. Benchmarked  the process of launching a new microschool and the partnerships fee. 
					Built a financial model to define potential income share agreements for different partnership models.
			
				</p>
				
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">3. Prototype and Testing:</h6>
				<p>
					Designed a “franchise” partnership model in which the company shared the frameworks, processes, content, tools, certification, and brand among others to carry out the operation of the microschool. Ran a pilot in Guadalajara, Jalisco.
			
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Findings</h6>
				<p>
		
					</div>
					Potential Family Partners:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Most families were parents that were looking for alternative educational models, that were highly involved with the education of their children. These families had already investigated other alternative educational models prior to reaching out to Yourney.</li>
					<li>All the families had been following our education model for a long time and had been asking about opening a franchise in their states.</li>
					<li>Most of the families had an entrepreneurial background and were onboard with the revenue share model.</li>
					<li>It is essential to do a deep due diligence on the potential partners to ensure that the partners share the philosophy, values, and vision of Yourney’s model.</li>

				
				</ul>
	
				<p>
					Microschools model:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There are two main income schemes to open a new school. One of them asks for an initial fee to start, while the other asks for a higher monthly fee.</li>
					<li>Even though the onboarding and opening process is similar, the main difference consists in the focus of the process of launching a new microschool (e.g. being educator led and/or being family led).</li>

				</ul>
				<p>
					Delivery

				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Besides the know-how of the educational model, families value the accompaniment and networking of Yourney’s community.</li>
					<li>It is essential to deliver an in-house certification process and an initial investment to demonstrate the compromise and willingness to be a Yourney’s partner.</li>
					<li>Constant feedback and training to assure the quality of the delivery.</li>
				
				</ul>
			</div>
	
		<div>
				
			<h4 class="subtitle">Recommendations</h4>
			
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The proposal was to launch a microschool in Nuevo Leon, the same operating state, to pilot, verify, discard and adjust the hipotesis of the expansion model.</li>
				<li>Yourney’s philosophy consists of having the children in the center. As such, the  compliance of the day-to-day process is highly important to assure the quality and standards of the brand. All these things would be easier to initially monitor in a nearby microschool.</li>
