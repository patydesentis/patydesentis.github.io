			<h4 class="subtitle">Problem</h4>
			<p>The privately owned State of Mexico rural hospital serves mostly women from nearby low-income communities. In the past few years, patient volume has decreased 30% for unknown reasons.</p>

			<h4 class="subtitle">Metodology</h4>
			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">User research (Qualitative):</h6>
				<p>
					Conducted a socio-demographic population analysis to understand the characteristics of the patients in nearby hospitals and municipalities.
					Mapped the public and private services and needs in the hospital town and in the main towns that are located within 1-hour driving. 
					Made three on-campus visits, each of them with a specific objective:

					<ul>
						<li>Explored the user experience, services, and prices of the main competitors, through 20 interviews to identify the hospital average patient persona.</li>
						<li>Conducted deep interviews with people from nearby municipalities to understand patients and families experiences with the health system. Identified the socio-economic profile, the community's current health status, needs, issues, and their expectations of ideal health services.</li>
						<li>Conducted deep interviews with patients and employees of the hospital and went through the hospital’s patient experience to identify pain points in the process. Mapped the whole process and identified the pain points on each point of contact with the patient from entering the hospital to the exit.</li>
					
					</ul>
				
				</p>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Quantitative analysis:</h6>
				<p>
					At a macro level, investigated the health trends as well as the health competitors in the zone.
			
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Recomendations</h6>
				<p>
					After 3 months, presented the Board of Directors insights of the market and hospital in the following areas:
					</div>
					1) Current health system market opportunities and trends
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Findings: Chronicle diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular diseases are the main issues in the state, there are no hospitals around the hospital.</li>
					<li>Recommendation: Bringing specialists in those areas and renting consulting and surgery rooms would increase the income and awareness.</li>
					<li>Findings: The population in the state uses traditional rituals to give birth at home. Women prefer gynecologists women to men because of family beliefs.</li>
					<li>Recommendations: Hire more women gynecologists. Give access to “parteras” to receive baby borns in the hospital would increase the hospital's awareness, services, and reduce the risk in births.</li>
					<li>Findings: There are very few laboratories in the municipality.</li>
					<li>Recommendations: Implement laboratory samples pick up spots in nearby towns can create more awareness of the hospital and increase other services.</li>
					<li>Recommendations: Establish alliances with other clinics to provide lab services.</li>
				
				</ul>
	
				<p>
					2) Go-to-market recommendations:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Launch a referral program to promote the hospital in the town and nearby municipalities.</li>
					<li>Launch strategies such as loyalty programs (e.g. patient membership), cross-selling services, and multiple services packages.</li>
					<li>Analyze the prices and margins of the services to compare them with competitors.</li>
					<li>Launch campaigns in the hospital aligned with national and international health days to attract new patients.</li>
					<li>Launch traditional marketing strategies such as fliers and megaphones.</li>
				</ul>

				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Messages</h6>
				<p>
					Parents were accompanying children. Teenagers were reading by themselves while parents worked. Some parents were reading to their children or playing with them. Adults were working by themselves or in pairs. Those who were reading were usually alone. Private rooms had groups of 4-8 people in meetings.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Services</h6>
				<p>
					No music was playing in the background. The teenagers section had TV’s which displayed advertisement regarding events, useful information or services offered by the library. Some examples of things displayed were: First Job Tips (how to prepare for interviews), and tutors available for help with certain subjects. There’s also signs around the library with this month’s calendar.
					In the library people can read, rent books, use computers, use the technology petting zoo with different devices, rent computers, eat, play chess, talk.

				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Expected observation</h6>
				<p>
					I was expecting to see books and I did see lots of them about every topic I can imagine. Something unexpected is that besides books, the library also has laptops and tablets you can rent, and other technical devices like 3D printers.
				</p>
				<h6 class="section-subtitle">Interesting observation</h6>
				<p>
					The library is a very diverse place. There were people from all ethnicities, ages, and economic statuses. Nobody looked uncomfortable or as an outsider. I think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that there’s something available for everyone: from books of all genres and topics, to CD’s, Zines, Manga, and technology, and its comfortable and warm design. The library makes everyone feel welcome no matter their background, and I think it’s uncommon to find this on a government-owned building.
